Python app that lets you record your non-ranked games and get stats for them

Dependencies:

* elixir/sqlalchemy: pip install elixir (or download from main page)

* lxml: pip install lxml (or download from main page)

* html-py: http://www.decalage.info/python/html#attachments

* Cx-Freeze(optional, used to freeze the program to an executable): http://cx-freeze.sourceforge.net/

Unfinished yet, but you can start recording your stats by modifying the lolking url in utilities/constants.py,
and running it once a day.

Will update soon!
