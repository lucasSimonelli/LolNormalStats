Python (32 bit) app that lets you record your non-ranked games and get stats for them

Dependencies [all 32-bit]:

* elixir/sqlalchemy: pip install elixir; pip install SQLAlchemy==0.7.8

* lxml: pip install lxml (or https://pypi.python.org/pypi/lxml/3.2.4#downloads [way easier in win32])

* html-py: http://www.decalage.info/python/html#attachments

* Python Image Library: http://www.pythonware.com/products/pil/

* Cx-Freeze(optional, used to freeze the program to an executable): http://cx-freeze.sourceforge.net/

Unfinished yet, but you can start recording your stats by modifying the lolking url in utilities/constants.py,
and running it once a day.

Will update soon!
